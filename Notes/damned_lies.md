# Excerpt from Damned Lies and Statistics: <br />Untangling Numbers from the Media, Politicians, and Activists

### By Joel Best

### History and Purpose of Statistics
* There are clear patterns of cycles of competing statistics.
    1. Difference between the estimated number of prostitutes in New York depending on if you
    ask a minister or a cop.
    2. Homelessness in America depending on if you were for or against Ronald Reagan's
    presidency.

* Social Statistics
    * "statistics" got its modern meaning (numeric evidence) in the 1830s
    * Social Statistics have two purposes
        1. Public: "Give accurate, true description of society"
        2. Hidden: "Supply ammunition for political struggles"
        * It's important not to take numbers as accurate merely because they are numbers.

### Creating Social Problems
Social problems are "created" in a sense by different people for different reasons. A new
social problem is really a narrative being pushed by interested parties. Activists, media,
experts (scientists, professors etc), politicians, and bureaucrats all stand to gain
from creating awareness of what they term a social problem.

"Figures may not lie, but liars figure."

### The Public As An Innumerate Audience

* \"Innumeracy - widespread confusion about basic mathematical ideas - means that many statistical
claims about social problems don't get the critical attention they deserve.\"

* Often people accept statistics because they assume that the numbers come from experts
who are both trustworthy and competent. This and some level of innumeracy lead to numbers
being accepted as facts.

* \"Official statistics reflect what sociologists call  _organizational practices_ -
the organization's culture and structure shape officials actions, and those actions determine
whatever statistics finally emerge.\"


### Thinking About Statistics As Social Products

* \"All statistics are social products, the results of people's efforts.\"

* Three Basic Questions To As When Presented With Statistics
    1. \"Who created this statistic?\"
    2. \"Why was this statistic created?\"
    3. \"How was this statistic created?\"

* \"Methods of creating statistics are key.\"
